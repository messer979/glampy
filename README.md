Go live metric capture tool.

This script relies upon "GLAM Master Report.xlsx" and "Data Integrity Checks.xlsx" which are not part of this repo since they contain DB information. Please email me separately if you require copies of these spreadheets.

To use this script, ensure you have followed all instructions in the "Instant Client Instructions.docs" file.

If all instructions have been followed, download the exe to your local computer. If you have the required excel files, set up the oracle DB connection in the correct sheet, and are on the appropriate network to connect to the target DB, then just run the exe. Spreadsheets will update based on results from queries executed.
